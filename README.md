<h3 align="justified">I'm Kura (´・ω・`) An 19 year old passionate programmer & artist. </h3> 
<h4 align="justified">My projects are fueled by my passion for technology, art, and my otaku nature. I want to proudly display my fanworks for everyone to see, without holding back. I want my work to be a reflection of everything I enjoy, unfiltered and authentic. By combining art, technology, and my love for anime and gaming, I aim to create a space where others feel inspired to embrace their own passions without hesitation. Every project I take on is not just about showcasing skills—it's about celebrating the joy and connection fandom brings.</h4>
<h6 align="justified">Through my creations, I want to break down the stigma around being an otaku and prove that there's no shame in loving what you love. Whether it's through fan art, coding projects based on favorite anime/manga, or collaborations with others in the community, my goal is to express myself boldly, inspire, and show that creativity has no boundaries.</h6>
